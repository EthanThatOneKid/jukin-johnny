## About
I created this game at the beginning of my junior year of high school. The previous summer, I had deep-dived into JavaScript and web development (having only known QBasic before this) and I felt like a new man. I became an intellectual because I felt as though I redeemed my self-worth as an individual by teaching myself such a valuable skill! It was a good feeling.

Junior year, I was in EspaÃ±ol III and there were plenty of other intellectual students in that class that I knew as friends, such as Jason, Jessica, and Johnny. Now, Johnny is a friend of mine that I have known since kindergarten. He has always been a very talented individual and I was always very impressed and envious of his unrelenting skill and scholarly ability. In my mind, he was practically a super hero; which inspired me to use my newfound abilities of programming to bring this idea to life.

I made a game about Johnny called *Jukin' Johnny*. In the game, Johnny is controlled by the player's arrow keys and his face runs around the tennis court avoiding the devilish F. Since Johnny is such a talented person, I characterized *Jukin' Johnny* as an entity who always avoids bad grades, hence the devilish F. The game takes place in a tennis court because Johnny was on the tennis team at the time, making him a truly well-rounded individual, furthering my admiration for him.

At my high school, we had a cart of Chromebook laptops in every class, and the teachers were encouraged to implement technology in the classroom at every opportunity. We used them in several classes every single day which called for some well-deserved, yet inevitable slacking activities. We were always trusted to use them in a scholarly manner, but in reality, there was a very interesting unblocked gaming culture at my high school. Most websites were blocked by the school district, so we needed innovation. Some honorable mentions may include cool-math-games, renditions of bloons tower defense, and keyboard type racing games. URLs of unblocked websites were murmured and unblocked YouTube proxies came and went. I wanted to be the creator of the next cool unblocked game of the unblocked games culture of my high school.

One of cool features I added to the game over time was the student store. In exchange for an amount of points, the devilish F would shrink, allowing for some breathing room for the player. This feature was pretty broken and changed the metagame completely. New high scores were coming in constantly. At the time, I had no idea how to make a database to make the game self-sufficient, so if someone wanted their name on the high score list, they would have to personally show me an image as proof of their high score and I would manually add it to a google spreadsheet which was visible in the *Jukin' Johnny* webpage. The name of the spreadsheet was titled Jukin' Masters.

The game was created using the p5 framework. I used it because I was very familiar with the variables and functions and stuff in it because I had learned JavaScript on Khan Academy which taught using an interesting combination of JavaScript and Processing, but it wasn't p5. p5 was very similar, however.

Another feature that I added was a song playlist. At the time, it was possible to generate an iframe, make it invisible, and set a YouTube video to auto play upon loading and loop when the video ended. I had hardcoded the playlist which included poppin, hawt songs such as stereo saiyan, brain power, and happy little cloud. Unfortunately, the setup I had created for that feature has been deprecated by Google and no longer works :(

Looking back on this project, two summers later (now having graduated high school as of a few weeks ago), I think it was a really great experience for me to let all of my friends know how cool I was for creating a game and being able to play it at school on my own website. I knew something that nobody else at my high school knew: how to program literally anything, and that made me feel special. ðŸ˜Š
